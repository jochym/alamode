- New tag ``KAPPA_SPEC`` in **anphon** for calculating spectra of thermal conductivity
- New option ``--offset`` in **extract.py** for subtracting residual forces (displacements) in an equilibrium structure from training data sets. We recommended to use this option if internal coordinates of atoms (Wyckoff potisions) have free parameters.
- New option ``--isotope`` in **analyze_phonons.py**

## Changes

- Improve the performance of thermal conductivity calculations with the tetrahedron method (``ISMEAR=-1``). The new version is <Font color='red'>more than 3 times faster</font> than the previous version.
- Improve the efficiency of the algorithm for generating constraings for the translational invariance
- Avoid 'NaN' in thermal conductivity calculations with imaginary branches
- Loosen the default value of ``TOLERANCE`` for detecting crystal symmetry
- Stop printing the CLASSICAL entry in PREFIX.result files

- Fixed an invalid memory reference in **analyze_phonons.cpp**
- Added a routine to check the consistency of the crystal structure when the ``FC2XML`` tag is used in **anphon**


# Ver. 0.9.7 (2016-3-10)

## New

- New option ``SPS = 2`` in anphon
- New tag ``MAGMOM`` for considering collinear spin (alm). The format is same as VASP.
- ALAMODE logo 

## Changes

- From this version, the variable 'NNP' for the translational part of 
  space group operations will no longer be used. Because of this, 
  file formats of SYMM_INFO and SYMM_INFO_PRIM also changed.

- Comment lines in the &cell, &position, and &kpoints fields are supported.

- Any words starting from 'N' or 'n' can be used instead of 'None' for the &cutoff field.

## Fix

- Fixed a bug in fitting.cpp (alm) regarding out-of-range of an array.
- Fixed a bug in the calculation of the maximum distance for multi-body interaction clusters.
- Fixed a bug in the calculation of constraints for translational invariance. 
  This bug appeared in previous versions with some specific structures/cutoff radii.
- anphon code incorrectly printed RMSD instead of MSD in previous versions. Fixed.
- qe2alm.cpp now works with ibrav=0.
- Fixed several issues in displace.py and extract.py for processing QE files.
- ``PRINTPR`` now works properly when KPMODE = 0.


# Ver. 0.9.6 (2015-09-14)

## New

- New option ``ICONST=11`` in **alm** which considers translational invariance algebraically

- ``FC2XML``-tag in **anphon**. Using this tag, it is now possible to employ different size of 
   supercells for harmonic and anharmonic terms.

- qe2alm.cpp in the tools/ directory which converts Quantum-ESPRESSO fc files to ALAMODE xml files.

- Changed the meaning of ``--calc=cumulative`` in analyze_phonons.py. 
   The ``--calc=cumulative`` in the previous version is now equivalent to ``--calc=cumulative2``.
